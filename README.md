# OO-FeVer

object-oriented finite volume solver.

## Description

OO-FeVer is an object-oriented, (modern) Fortran-based finite volume solver for advection-diffusion-reaction equations. In principle, FeVer will be designed with an OOP mindset for the purpose of solving simple hydrodynamics problems. In the end, the hope is to have a complete hydrodynamics solver (Riemann-solver) that additionally supports contributions from source terms, such as radioactive decay, nuclear fusion, ad hoc sources, etc. This software will also be adapted to HPC use through openMP and MPI.

## Getting Started

* Fortran 2003 (or later) supporting compiler.
* Python 3 (at minimum numpy and matplotlib.pyplot packages installed)

### Installing

* TBD

```
echo "Someday there will be code here"
```

## Help

OUTLINE of the "grid" class for FeVer


GRID
    
    - collection of x,y,z arrays
        -- 1D vectors
        -- uses "vector" class to define grid nodes and cell centers


    - collection of data arrays (temp, density, mass, energy...)
        -- 3D tensors (designed to be functionally lower dimension when needed)
        -- uses the "tensor" class
